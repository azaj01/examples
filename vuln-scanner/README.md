# Vulnerability Scanner

Scans a GitHub repo for SQLi, XSS, SSRF, and auth-bypass vulnerabilities using parallel Claude detectors. Triages false positives, generates patches, and validates each patch against the project's real test suite.

## Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then put your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`.

## Run

```bash
python vuln_scanner.py
```

Defaults to OWASP/NodeGoat. Press enter through the prompts to use defaults.

## How it works

The agent runs locally and drives Claude through detect → triage → patch, but every operation that touches untrusted code — cloning the repo, installing `npm`/`pip` dependencies, applying patches, running the project's real test suite — happens inside a [Tensorlake](https://cloud.tensorlake.ai/) sandbox. Tensorlake gives us a disposable VM built once from a declarative `Image` (`ubuntu-systemd` + `git`/`node`/`npm`/`python3`/`pytest`), per-scan isolation with explicit CPU/memory/disk/timeout budgets, and a simple `run` / `read_file` / `write_file` API so the local driver can manipulate the workspace without SSH or Docker plumbing.

1. Clones the target repo into the sandbox.
2. For each source file, runs 4 specialist Claude detectors in parallel.
3. A triage agent classifies findings as `confirmed` / `likely` / `false_positive`.
4. Generates a patch for each surviving finding.
5. Applies each patch in the sandbox, runs `npm test` / `pytest`, reverts.
6. Reports pass/fail per patch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Tensorlake account](https://cloud.tensorlake.ai/)
